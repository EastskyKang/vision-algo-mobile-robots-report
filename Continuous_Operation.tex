\chapter{Continuous Opertaion}
After the initializationVO is executed the visual odometry pipeline uses new sequence of images to update the pose of the camera.

\section{Triangulating New Landmarks}

\section{Pose Estimation}
Pose is estimated using using nonlinear optimization of the reprojection error. 


\subsection{Outlier Rejection}
Outlier rejection was done using RANSAC.


\section{Bundle Adjustment}
Full bundle adjustment of the pose and landmarks were applied to prevent the visual odometry from having scale drift. Bundle adjustment is applied as a window of 3 consecutive frames with one frame overlapping. A window based approach was implemented as a more computationally feasible operation.
